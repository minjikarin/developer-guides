Click on Register . Complete the form using a valid email address and click on the Create account button. An automatic confirmation email will be sent to the email address you provided. In the confirmation email you receive, click on Activate your account . You can now log in to the portal with your new credentials! Welcome to Amadeus for Developers ! Step 2: Get your API key To start using the APIs, you need to tell the system that you are allowed to do so. This process is called authorization. Danger Remember that the API Key and API Secret are for personal use only. Do not share them with anyone. All you need to do, is to attach an alphanumeric string called token to your calls. This token will identify you as a valid user. Each token is generated from two parameters: API Key and API Secret . Once your account has been verified, you can get your API key and API Secret by following these steps: Sign in to the Developers Portal . Click on your username (located in the top right corner of the Developers portal page) Go to My Self-Service Workspace . Click on Create New App button. Enter your application details and click on Create . Important Test environment At this stage, you are using the testing environment, where you will enjoy a fixed number of free API call quotas per month for all your applications. When you reach the limit, you will receive an error message. This environment will help you build and test your app for free and get ready for deploying it to the market. Step 3: Calling the API For our first call, let's get a list of possible destinations from Paris for a maximum amount of 200 EUR using the Flight Inspiration Search API , which returns a list of destinations from a given origin along with the cheapest price for each destination. Creating the Request Before making your first API call, you need to get your access token . For security purposes, we implemented the oauth2 process that will give you an access token based on your API Key and API Secret. To retrieve the token , you need to send a POST request to the endpoint /v1/security/oauth2/token with the correct Content-Type header and body. Replace {client_id} with your API Key and {client_secret} with your API Secret in the command below and execute it: 1 2 3 curl \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/security/oauth2/token\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" \\ -d \"grant_type=client_credentials&client_id={client_id}&client_secret={client_secret}\" Warning Please take a look at our Authorization guide to understand how the process works in depth. According to the documentation, you need to use v1/shopping/flight-destinations as the endpoint, followed by the mandatory query parameter origin . As you want to filter the offers to those cheaper than 200 EUR, you need to add the maxPrice parameter to your query as well. Our call is therefore: 1 2 curl 'https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-destinations?origin=PAR&maxPrice=200' \\ -H 'Authorization: Bearer ABCDEFGH12345' Note how we add the Authorization header to the request with the value Bearer string concatenated with the token previously requested. Evaluating the Response The response returns a JSON object containing a list of destinations matching our criteria: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 { \"data\" : [ { \"type\" : \"flight-destination\" , \"origin\" : \"PAR\" , \"destination\" : \"CAS\" , \"departureDate\" : \"2022-09-06\" , \"returnDate\" : \"2022-09-11\" , \"price\" : { \"total\" : \"161.90\" } }, { \"type\" : \"flight-destination\" , \"origin\" : \"PAR\" , \"destination\" : \"AYT\" , \"departureDate\" : \"2022-10-16\" , \"returnDate\" : \"2022-10-31\" , \"price\" : { \"total\" : \"181.50\" } } ] } Congratulations!

OAuth generates an access token which grants the client permission to access a protected resource. The method to acquire a token is called grant . There are different types of OAuth grants . Amadeus for Developers uses the Client Credentials Grant . Requesting an access token Once you have created an app and received your API Key and API Secret , you can generate an access token by sending a POST request to the authorization server: https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/security/oauth2/token/ Information Remember that your API Key and API Secret should be kept private. Read more about best practices for secure API key storage . The body of the request is encoded as x-www-form-urlencoded , where the keys and values are encoded in key-value tuples separated by '&', with a '=' between the key and the value: Key Value grant_type The value client_credentials client_id The API Key for the application client_secret The API Secret for the application Specify the type of the request using the content-type HTTP header with the value application/x-www-form-urlencoded . The following example uses cURL to request a new token: 1 2 3 curl \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/security/oauth2/token\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" \\ -d \"grant_type=client_credentials&client_id={client_id}&client_secret={client_secret}\" Note that the -X POST parameter is not needed in the cURL command. As we are sending a body, cURL sends the request as POST automatically. Response The authorization server will respond with a JSON object: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 { \"type\" : \"amadeusOAuth2Token\" , \"username\" : \"foo@bar.com\" , \"application_name\" : \"BetaTest_foobar\" , \"client_id\" : \"3sY9VNvXIjyJYd5mmOtOzJLuL1BzJBBp\" , \"token_type\" : \"Bearer\" , \"access_token\" : \"CpjU0sEenniHCgPDrndzOSWFk5mN\" , \"expires_in\" : 1799 , \"state\" : \"approved\" , \"scope\" : \"\" } The response will contain the following parameters: Parameter Description type The type of resource. The value will be amadeusOAuth2Token . username Your username (email address). application_name The name of your application. client_id The API Key for your application token_type The type of token issued by the authentication server. The value will be Bearer . access_token The token to authenticate your requests. expires_in The number of seconds until the token expires. state The status of your request. Values can be approved or expired . Using the token Once the token has been retrieved, you can authenticate your requests to Amadeus Self-Service APIs. Each API call must contain the authorization HTTP header with the value Bearer {access_token} , where acess_token is the token you have just retrieved. The following example is a call to the Flight Check-in Links API to retrieve the check-in URL for Iberia ( IB ): 1 2 curl \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/reference-data/urls/checkin-links?airline=IB\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer CpjU0sEenniHCgPDrndzOSWFk5mN\" Managing tokens from your source code To retrieve a token using your favourite programming language, send a POST request and parse the JSON response as in the cURL examples above. There are different strategies to maintain your token updated, like checking the time remaining until expiration before each API call or capturing the unauthorized error when the token expires. In both cases, you must request a new token. To simplify managing the authentication process, you can use the Amadeus for Developers SDKs available on GitHub. The SDKs automatically fetch and store the access_token and set the headers in all API calls. Example of initializing the client and authenticating with the Node SDK: 1 2 3 4 5 6 var Amadeus = require ( 'amadeus' ); var amadeus = new Amadeus ({ clientId : '[API Key]' , clientSecret : '[API Secret]' }); You can then call the API. The following example is a call to the Flight Check-in Links API to retrieve the check-in URL for Iberia ( IB ): 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 var Amadeus = require ( 'amadeus' ); var amadeus = new Amadeus ({ clientId : '[API Key]' , clientSecret : '[API Secret]' }); amadeus . referenceData . urls . checkinLinks . get ({ airlineCode : 'IB' }). then ( function ( response ){ console . log ( response . data ); }). catch ( function ( responseError ){ console . log ( responseError . code ); });","title":"Authorization"},{"location":"API-Keys/authorization/#authorizing-your-application","text":"Amadeus for Developers uses OAuth to authenticate access requests.

Each API call must contain the authorization HTTP header with the value Bearer {access_token} , where acess_token is the token you have just retrieved. The following example is a call to the Flight Check-in Links API to retrieve the check-in URL for Iberia ( IB ): 1 2 curl \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/reference-data/urls/checkin-links?airline=IB\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer CpjU0sEenniHCgPDrndzOSWFk5mN\"","title":"Using the token"},{"location":"API-Keys/authorization/#managing-tokens-from-your-source-code","text":"To retrieve a token using your favourite programming language, send a POST request and parse the JSON response as in the cURL examples above. There are different strategies to maintain your token updated, like checking the time remaining until expiration before each API call or capturing the unauthorized error when the token expires. In both cases, you must request a new token. To simplify managing the authentication process, you can use the Amadeus for Developers SDKs available on GitHub. The SDKs automatically fetch and store the access_token and set the headers in all API calls. Example of initializing the client and authenticating with the Node SDK: 1 2 3 4 5 6 var Amadeus = require ( 'amadeus' ); var amadeus = new Amadeus ({ clientId : '[API Key]' , clientSecret : '[API Secret]' }); You can then call the API.
